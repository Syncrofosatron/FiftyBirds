# FiftyBirds

This was the second game I made while I was learning game development.

Game engine used: Love2D
Language: Lua

The game skeleton is built by the instructor, our job is to implement some feature so below are the features I implemented.
As I was learning pixel art at the same time, I made the trophies for this which we get as a reward.

1. Added variation in individual pipes length and the distance between them to create more challenging environment.
2. Implemented a pause feature with the press of a key.
3. Implemented the achievement system (Gold, Silver and Bronze trophy) to reward the player based on the distance they cover.
